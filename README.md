# cyberpunk-template
- This cyberpunk themed template is for a links page. It is written completely in vanilla html and css. Creative use of images and css animations is what makes it work. 
- All images used for this template are free stock images which can be replaced.
- I altered the background image using Adobe Illustrator's image trace to give it a vector look.
## There are still some things that need tweaking
- I want to convert the breakpoints that add responsiveness to be mobile first since the template is primarily meant to be viewed on mobile.
- I still have to adjust the responsiveness for some of the larger width screen sizes as well as the smaller heights.
- I want to add more documentation to the code so it is more understandable.
- Optimize images for screens to improve loading.
