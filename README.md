# cyberpunk-template
This cyberpunk themed template is for a links page. It is written completely in vanilla html and css. Creative use of images and css animations is what makes it work. 
All images used for this template are free stock images which can be replaced.
I altered the background image using Adobe Illustrator's image trace to give it a vector look.
There are still some things that need tweaking
 - I want to convert the breakpoints that add responsiveness to be mobile first since the template is primarily meant to be viewe on mobile.
- I still have to adjust the responsiveness for some of the larger screen sizes.
